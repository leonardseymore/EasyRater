        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        EasyRater is designed to get all your music tracks rated.  It uses the following guidelines to give you the best experience:
            <ul>
                <li>Streamlined with your workflow - Unobstrusively allow you to rate your songs without having to stop what you are currently doing.</li>
                <li>Clearly indicate current rating - You need to see if the song is currently rated if you want to set it.</li>
                <li>Minimize screen real estate usage - We don't want to waste any precious screen space.</li>
                <li>Eliminate songs unworthy of a rating - Sometimes a song should rather get deleted.</li>
                <li>(Extra) Highlight your favorite song - When you see that indicator lighting up, get ready for one of your favorites.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>See song rating</h2>
        <p>
        The application is driven by the status bar item:
            <div>
                <img src="shrd/indicator.png">
            </div>
        You can expect the following values in the preview icon:
            <ul>
                <li><img src="shrd/ratingStarUnknown.png"> - A song is playing that has not yet been rated</li>
                <li><img src="shrd/ratingStar1.png"> - A song rated with 1 stars</li>
                <li><img src="shrd/ratingStar2.png"> - A song rated with 2 stars</li>
                <li><img src="shrd/ratingStar3.png"> - A song rated with 3 stars</li>
                <li><img src="shrd/ratingStar4.png"> - A song rated with 4 stars</li>
                <li><img src="shrd/ratingStar5.png"> - A favorite is playing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Set song rating</h2>
        <p>
        Click on the icon to open to the application menu:
            <div>
                <img src="shrd/menu.png">
            </div>
        The menu is divided into three sections:
        <ul>
            <li>Delete - Delete the currently playing song</li>
            <li>Rating - Select the desired rating for the song</li>
            <li>Quit - Quit the application</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Delete song</h2>
        <p>
        From the status bar open the menu and select the "Delete" menu item.
        An alert window will pop up to make sure you really want to delete the track:
            <div>
                <img src="shrd/deleteAlert.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>WARNING</strong>: Deleted items are permanently deleted, they do <strong>NOT</strong> go to the trash!</strong>
            </div>
        </p>
        
            
        <h2>Quit application</h2>
        <p>
        From the status bar open the menu and select the "Quit" menu item.
        </p>
